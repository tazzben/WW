Builds only with the development version of pyinstaller:

https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/

1. Install latest version of python from python.org
2. Install dependancies using pip3
3. Bundle using .spec file -- does not support onefile (this is ok, as it hides the files in the bundle).
4. You must create empty tcl and tk directories inside of bundle (MacOS folder)
5. Copy tk8.6 and tcl8.6 folders and config files (.sh) from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/ to MacOS folder in the bundle
6. Modify plist file in the bundle

Notes:  Starting in python 3.6.5, python bundled its own version of tcl and tk -- this is the source of much of the conflicts.  Other versions of tcl and tk don't have an interface in 10.14, which is why the buttons show up blank.
